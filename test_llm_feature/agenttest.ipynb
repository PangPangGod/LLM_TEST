    "1.0 PURPOSE :    This standard outlines the general requirements for steel used by AAM or its suppliers in the  manufacture of AAM components.    2.0 SCOPE:     This standard covers the general guidelines for steelmaking, deoxidation, ladle metallurgy,  cleanliness, grain refining, vacuum degassing, casting, rolling and inspection practices for Special  Bar Quality (SBQ) bars used in the manufacture of AAM products.    Additional requirements for specific steel grades and end uses are covered by an AAM Material  Specification (MS-XXXX-X or MS-XXXX).    If this specification and the individual MS specification or part drawing are in conflict, then the  individual MS specification or part drawing takes precedence.    Revisions to this specification are required in writing to the Director or designee of AAM Corporate  Materials Engineering.    3.0 REFERENCES:\n",
